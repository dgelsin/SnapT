SnapT v=0.3 (TBD)
	added expression curve analysis to remove lowly expressed transcripts
	increased minimum basepair coverage during transcript assembly from 2.5 to 10

SnapT v=0.2 (February 2019)
	stringtie assembly is now guided
	added explicit genome indexing handling
	prokka is run if the user does not provide an annotation
	if there is a small peptide (<100nt) encoded in a much larger (3X) transcript, it can still be called a ncRNA
	non-coding transcripts need to overlap at least 10nt with opposite strand gene to be called antisense
	modified tip of contig thresholding to be more stringent
	added -l option to allow t specify smallest contig size
	snapt scripts are now dirrectly located in /bin/

SnapT v=0.1 (January 2019)
	Wrap sRNA discovery pipeline into usable wrapper
	First user-friendly version of SnapT
